                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>During these uncertain and unpresidented times, the health of both our staff, and customers is of paramount importance to us.  As such, and in accordance with Government Orders,  the Guitar Store will be closed until further notice.</p>  Last night (23rd), the Government posted advice stating that online retailers were still permitted to operate.   Our initial intention is to have one member of staff  (thereby operating in isolation) working in the shop between 10am and 3pm (weekdays) so that we can continue to accept deliveries and process and despatch on-line orders.  We will continue to enforce distancing rules, personal / shop hygiene and safe travel to and from work for that member of staff.
